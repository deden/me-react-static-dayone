My online course was almost running out of the schedule. So I needed to force my self to worked on it until late night.\n\nYeay! I bought my personal domain \"deden.me\", at $2.99 yesterday. Hopefully, I can set up this site today. I've planned to use Hugo as the web framework. This personal site should be a static site, so it should be easier to let me work on it.\n\nEventually, after researching at GitHub, I found a react static generator, named Gatsby library. It seems similar with Hugo, unless it based on React, whereas Hugo developed from Golang.\n\n> Next ideas are a small business, or one-person startup, and vision plus skillset.\n\nThis article shows good stories about how one person can build their startup, https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2014\/07\/successful-one-person-startups.html. \nMany successful businesses started with just one person who had a vision and the technical skills to deliver it to the world.\nEven some of largest companies in the world like eBay and Amazon began with one tech-savvy founder. It must have taken a super amount of work, regardless their vision, skills, and talent.\n\nBtw, I’ve made a gist contains curated links of repo related with my researches on Machine Learning and AI topics.

You would see what tables are available at what times and you’d be able to book a specific table for a specific time. You could do it on the web or using a mobile app without needing to call the restaurant. You  can pick your seats on a plane, why not a restaurant?\n\nKey Features :\n- You can develop your app for both iOS and Android platforms once with React Native. Make development faster and effective with this template.\n- Cool animation\n- Excellent UX\n- Auto Layout\n\n\n## CodeCanyon guidelines:\n> Ensure your app is focused on improving workflow for developers.\n\nConsider supporting universal and multipurpose template. In example: The layout of the menu is completely customisable (icon, titles, sections), in addition you can add as many items to the menu as you like.",
